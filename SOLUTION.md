Hi, I was not able to finish the challenge in 4 hours. Hence, I stopped working after 4 hours and started writting this document.

I added 2 methods in the Autocomplete.js file.
-callWebApi() which calls the github api and addes the query and the numOfResults in teh url. then returns the result back to the getResults() method. (callWebApi works synchronous because there was not enough time to make it works asynchronous)
-onKeyboardClick() is the second method. this is a method which has to be used everytime 'keydown' event is called. I was not able to create the 'keydown' event it self due to time.

-in the main.css file (result:focus) to change the color of the focused element.
